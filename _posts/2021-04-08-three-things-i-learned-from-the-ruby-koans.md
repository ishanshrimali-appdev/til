title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):

1: Regular Expression (regexp)
This can be used to identify certain characters or sets of characters and then perform actions on them. For example, one can split the words in a sentence using this.

2: Raising Exceptions
Exceptions can be raised so the user can be informed that something didn't work. See: "assert_raise"

3: Attribute Accessors
These are methods defined in a class that create a Ruby method under that name. There are three kinds:
"attr_accessor": both read/write capabilities
"attr_reader": read-only
"attr_writer": write-only
